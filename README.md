# Superpowers

Superpowers is a complete software development methodology for your coding agents, built on top of a set of composable skills and some initial instructions that make sure your agent uses them.

## How it works

It starts from the moment you fire up your coding agent. As soon as it sees that you're building something, it *doesn't* just jump into trying to write code. Instead, it steps back and asks you what you're really trying to do. 

Once it's teased a spec out of the conversation, it shows it to you in chunks short enough to actually read and digest. 

After you've signed off on the design, your agent puts together an implementation plan that's clear enough for an enthusiastic junior engineer with poor taste, no judgement, no project context, and an aversion to testing to follow. It emphasizes true red/green TDD, YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It), and DRY. 

Next up, once you say "go", it launches a *subagent-driven-development* process, having agents work through each engineering task, inspecting and reviewing their work, and continuing forward. It's not uncommon for your agent to work autonomously for a couple hours at a time without deviating from the plan you put together.

There's a bunch more to it, but that's the core of the system. And because the skills trigger automatically, you don't need to do anything special. Your coding agent just has Superpowers.

## Commercial Services

If you're using Superpowers in enterprise and could benefit from commercial support, additional tooling, or managed spending, please don't hesitate to drop us a line at sales@primeradiant.com.

## Installation (Claude Code)

This edition of Superpowers is tailored specifically for **Claude Code**.

Install directly from your local checkout or GitHub repository:

```bash
/plugin install .
```

Or install directly from the marketplace:

```bash
/plugin install duwscanspower --marketplace duwscan/superpowers
```

## The Basic Workflow

1. **brainstorming** - Activates before building anything. Draws out what you actually want, and why, through questions that get you describing it. Non-trivial codebase exploration during brainstorming is handled via the `Explore` subagent (`model: haiku`).

2. **Claude Code Native Planning** - Activates with approved design. Enter Claude Code's native Plan mode (`Plan` subagent) to decompose the design into bite-sized, verifiable tasks.

3. **subagent-driven-development** or **executing-plans** - Activates with plan. Either dispatches a fresh subagent per task with a review after each (token-optimized via dynamic model and effort selection based on task complexity), or implements tasks inline with a final whole-branch review at the end.

4. **test-driven-development** - Activates during implementation. Enforces RED-GREEN-REFACTOR: write failing test, watch it fail, write minimal code, watch it pass, commit. Deletes code written before tests.

5. **requesting-code-review** - Activates between tasks. Reviews against plan, reports issues by severity. Critical issues block progress.

6. **finishing-a-development-branch** - Activates when tasks complete. Verifies tests, presents options (merge/PR/keep/discard).

**The agent checks for relevant skills before any task.** Mandatory workflows, not suggestions.

## When Something Goes Wrong

Sometimes a session misbehaves: a skill fires when it shouldn't, stays silent when it should, or the agent ignores its plan, repeats work, or burns more tokens than you'd expect. Ask your coding agent to "figure out what went wrong with superpowers in this session" and it will invoke the **diagnosing-superpowers** skill. To examine an earlier session, name it: "figure out what went wrong with superpowers in session `<id>`".

The skill reads the session transcript, reports what happened with line-level evidence, and, if you want, packages a scrubbed bundle for a bug report.

## Community

Superpowers is built by [Jesse Vincent](https://blog.fsck.com) and the rest of the folks at [Prime Radiant](https://primeradiant.com).

**Debugging**
- **systematic-debugging** - 4-phase root cause process (includes root-cause-tracing, defense-in-depth, condition-based-waiting techniques)
- **verification-before-completion** - Ensure it's actually fixed
- **diagnosing-superpowers** - Work out what went wrong in a session, with evidence; export a scrubbed bundle or file an issue

**Collaboration**

**Meta**
- **writing-skills** - Create new skills following best practices (includes testing methodology)
- **using-superpowers** - Introduction to the skills system

## Philosophy

- **Test-Driven Development** - Write tests first, always
- **Systematic over ad-hoc** - Process over guessing
- **Complexity reduction** - Simplicity as primary goal
- **Evidence over claims** - Verify before declaring success

## Contributing

The general contribution process for Superpowers is below. Keep in mind that we don't generally accept contributions of new skills and that any updates to skills must work across all of the coding agents we support.

1. Fork the repository
2. Switch to the 'dev' branch
3. Create a branch for your work
4. Follow the `writing-skills` skill for creating and testing new and modified skills
5. Submit a PR, being sure to fill in the pull request template.

Skill-behavior tests use the drill eval harness from [superpowers-evals](https://github.com/prime-radiant-inc/superpowers-evals/), cloned into `evals/` — see `evals/README.md` for setup. Plugin-infrastructure tests live at `tests/` and run via the relevant `run-*.sh` or `npm test`.

See `skills/writing-skills/SKILL.md` for the complete guide.

## Updating

Superpowers updates are somewhat coding-agent dependent, but are often automatic.

## Visual companion telemetry

Because skills and plugins don't provide any feedback to creators, we have no idea how many of you are using Superpowers. By default, the Prime Radiant logo on brainstorming's optional visual companion feature is loaded from our website. It includes the version of Superpowers in use. It does not include any details about your project, prompt, or coding agent. We don't see your clicks or anything about what you're building. This helps us have a rough idea of how many folks are using Superpowers and which version of Superpowers they're using. It's 100% optional. To disable this, set the environment variable `SUPERPOWERS_DISABLE_TELEMETRY` to any true value. Superpowers also honors Claude Code's `DISABLE_TELEMETRY` and `CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_NONESSENTIAL_TRAFFIC` opt-outs.
